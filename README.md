This is an Advanced Command Handler for Discord Bots, which uses classes for commands & events.
You have a plethora of utils like functions that everyone uses, functions for errors,
functions for tedious things that everyone needs for a Discord Bot, and some classes to simplify Logging things and manipulating embeds.

This library is here to simplify a lot developing Discord Bots and is far from being finished with every feature I want to add.
So feel free to watch this repo for futures releases!

**For more information on how to use it, see the Guide and the Documentation :**

-   [Documentation](https://ayfri.github.io/Advanced-Command-Handler/) <br>
-   [Guide](https://github.com/Ayfri/Advanced-Command-Handler/wiki)

You can also see some examples that I've made [here](https://github.com/Ayfri/advanced-command-handler-examples).
Feel free to PR to these to update these and add features that this handler can offer!

### That's all for now :)
