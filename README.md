This is an Advanced Command Handler for Discord Bots, which uses classes for commands & events. You have a plethora of utils like functions that everyone uses, functions for errors, functions for
tedious things that everyone needs for a Discord Bot, and some classes to simplify Logging things and manipulating embeds.

**Version 3.0 uses Discord.js v12, wait for 3.1 to use Discord.js v13.**

This library is here to simplify a lot developing Discord Bots and is far from being finished with every feature I want to add.<br>
So feel free to watch this repo for futures releases!
For now, it offers :

- Command Handling
- SubCommand Handling
- Event Handling
- Default message event & help command
- A complete Logger
- Some utilities function for errors, jsons and other

**For more information on how to use it, see the Guide and the Documentation :**

- [Documentation](https://advanced-command-handler.github.io/docs/) <br>
- [Guide](https://ayfri.gitbook.io/advanced-command-handler/)

You can also see some examples that I've made [here](https://github.com/Ayfri/advanced-command-handler-examples).<br>
Feel free to PR to these to update these and add features that this handler can offer!

### That's all for now :)
